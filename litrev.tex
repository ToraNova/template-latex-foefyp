\chapter{Literature Review}
This chapter demonstrates your ability to review, and to report on relevant literature and past work on your given topic. A well written literature review:

\begin{itemize}
	\item allows the reader to easily place the focus of your FYP project within the context of the wider academic community in your field;
	\item reports your critical review of the relevant literature; and
	\item identifies a gap within that literature that your research will attempt to address.
\end{itemize}

\section{Guides on Writing Literature Review}
What you need to do before writing your literature review:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find relevant literature on your FYP topic and follow streams of references
	\item Identify important themes/ideas/theories/approaches to the topic that have emerged during your research on your respective FYP topic
	\item Introduce ideas by themes/theory/approach/chronologically or any other appropriate structure but do not just list different authorsâ€™ viewpoints
	\item Introduce and explain each theme (or theory/approach), present evidence from readings (agreements/disagreements), critically commentate and relate to your own research
	\item Carefully note down each reference you intend to include in your literature review
\end{enumerate}
