\chapter{Data Presentation and Discussion of Findings}
The results/data presentation and discussion sections can be both the most interesting as well as the most challenging sections to write. You may choose to write these sections separately, or combine them into a single chapter, depending on your preferences.

\section{Data Presentation}
There are three main methods of presenting your data, be it the results of your experiments, information that you have collected and analysed, or statistics from secondary sources (such as books, journal articles or newspaper reports):

\begin{itemize}
    \item it can be incorporated into the main body of text;
    \item it can be presented separately as a table; or
    \item it can be used to construct a graph or chart.
\end{itemize}

\section{Sample algorithm}
\lipsum[2]
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Euclid's algorithm}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
   \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
   \While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
      \State $a\gets b$
      \State $b\gets r$
      \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
   \EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
   \State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Sample Equation}

\lipsum[3]

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:soundness}
\begin{split}
	\frac{R_{SP_1}}{R_{SP_2}}^{\frac{1}{(C_{HA_1} - C_{HA_2})}} = \, & (\frac{ \delta^{ t+c_1 } }{ \delta^{ t+c_2 }})^{\frac{1}{(c_1 - c_2)}}  \\
	= \, &  (\delta^{c_1 - c_2})^{\frac{1}{c_1 - c_2}}  \\
	= \, &  \delta
\end{split}
\end{align}
