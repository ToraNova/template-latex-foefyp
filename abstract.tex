\textsf{foefyp} is a \LaTeX\ class for authoring theses that fulfil formatting specifications required by Multimedi University (MMU), Malaysia. The thesis preparation guide can be accessed at \url{http://foe.mmu.edu.my/v3/main/undergrad/fyp_report_guidelines.html}.

The cover page cannot be duplicated exactly, as a result, I recommend that you use the original cover page provided by http://foe.mmu.edu.my/v3/main/undergrad/Revised%20FYP%20Template%20v5.docx

For changes in formatting/margin or the copyright/declaration page, please edit on the foefyp.cls file.
