%!TEX root=thesis.tex
\textsf{foefyp} is a \LaTeX\ class for authoring theses that fulfil formatting specifications required by Multimedi University (MMU), Malaysia. The thesis preparation guide can be accessed at \url{http://research.mmu.edu.my/ips/node/188}.

A sample \texttt{thesis.tex} is included in the package, which I recommend you modify for your own thesis write-up. (You can rename it, but I'll stick with the file name `\texttt{thesis.tex}' throughout this guide.)
